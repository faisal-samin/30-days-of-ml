# 30-days-of-ml
Repository to capture updates of a 30 day self-directed journey to learn and revise ML concepts. 

## Day 0 (13-09-21)
The goal throughout these 30 days is to develop and revise Machine Learning knowledge by spending at least an hour everyday on reading, studying and learning concepts. Some general rules:

- I will tweet and document progress on twitter and github for self accountability.
- Use a variety of resources such as notebooks, MOOCs, books and video tutorials.

Some minimum goals in mind:

- Tackle at least 3 Kaggle challenges
- Go over 5 chapters of HOML
- Go over 5 chapters of ISLR
