# 30-days-of-ml
Repository to capture updates of a 30 day self-directed journey to learn and revise ML concepts. 

## Day 0 (13-09-21)
The goal throughout these 30 days is to develop and revise Machine Learning knowledge by spending at least an hour everyday on reading, studying and learning concepts. Some general rules:

- I will tweet and document progress on twitter and github for self accountability.
- Use a variety of resources such as notebooks, MOOCs, books and video tutorials.

Some minimum goals in mind:

- Tackle at least 3 Kaggle challenges
- Go over 5 chapters of HOML
- Go over 5 chapters of ISLR

## Day 1 (14-09-21)

Not a very successful start to the 30 days. Spent about an hour installing and configuring a new zsh shell (iTerm) to upgrade my terminal experience and feel like a pro.
However that led to issues when trying to launch a jupyter notebook. Currently trying to install this with brew but that's taking forever and doesn't appear to be working...

The plan was to go through the notebook for Chapter 2 of the excellent HOML (and the chapter itself is a super overview of the ML process from end to end) but the aforementioned 
distraction/bug cut into that. Better make up for this with some more study time tomorrow. 

Main takeaways today were the endless amount of configuration options for terminal shells, but also the advatanges of isolated environments for Python packages which I've got a (virtual) 
sticy note for. 

Hoping for progress tomorrow!
